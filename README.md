# Javascript Begineers Project

This is a repository where codes, programs and projects written in javascript are brought together for the growth, fast learning and also the creating of hand-on-projects
experiences for codenewbies (beginners) and developers in the `JAVASCRIPT` programming language



## For your contributions to be merged:

- Put the project, codes or program in a directory (like a repository)
- Add a `README file` which explains:
  - How to run the program locally
  - If possible, add necessary links either leading to an article, a video or a documentation that is related to the codes available
  - Explain the functions of each codes available in the repository or directory
  - If necessary, add snippets of codes explaining things difficult to understand in the `README file` of the project
  - Writing of comments in the codes would be of real help
